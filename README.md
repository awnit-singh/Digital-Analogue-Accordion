# Digital-Analogue-Accordion

This project for our intro circuitry and digital electronics class required us to combine both analogue and digital circuitry. We decided to build an accordion whereby the volume is determined by the rate of change of the distance between the two moving parts of the circuit, determined using analogue sensors. The accordion turns off using a set of flip flop timers within 10 seconds of a key being played, and can be switched back on by inputting a sequence using the said buttons/keys.
